<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose to conduct a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of [Ne II], X-ray emission, and accretion rate from the classical T Tauri star GM Aur.  Leveraging the variable nature of X-rays, [Ne II] emission, and the mass accretion rates of these sources, we will search for a correlations in these data to provide the first direct observational evidence of the role X-rays and EUV photons play in driving disk chemistry and the evolution of proto-planetary disks.  We have obtained data from our first epoch and request two additional MICHELLE observations to be obtained simultaneous to Chandra X-ray observations of GM Aur.
