<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
We propose to use IGRINS on Gemini-S to observe four planetary nebulae (PNe) in each of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.  These observations will provide an opportunity to directly measure enrichments of neutron(n)-capture elements by the s-process in low-metallicity PNe with different progenitor masses.  We will use the empirical abundances to test predictions of three different AGB evolutionary codes, providing constraints to key uncertainties including convection and mass-loss in a metal-poor regime that is not well-studied.  Our abundance determinations will also uniquely test whether the i-process, with neutron densities intermediate to the s- and r-processes, operated in PN progenitors as has been suggested for post-AGB stars in these galaxies.  Compensatory time observations with IGRINS on Gemini through U. Texas show that transitions of multiple n-capture elements can be detected in PNe with similar brightness to our targets, including weak lines of Rb and Te, demonstrating the feasibility of our scientific aims.
