<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
The circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of post-AGB stars provide a record
of the mass-loss that occurred earlier on the AGB and which dominates
the evolution of nearly all post-MS stars. In 2001A we used OSCIR on
Gemini-N to obtain mid-IR images of 4 post-AGB CSEs, selected from our
near-IR imaging polarimetry survey. By combining the mid- and near-IR
data we are exploring, via detailed models, the CSE structure and
composition, including dust density, grain sizes and degree of
axisymmetry. This provides direct information on the evolution of
mass-loss rates along the AGB, the dust formation process and the
onset of axisymmetries that ultimately lead to the observed
morphological diversity of PN.  We propose to continue and extend this
successful program to a further 8 targets using T-ReCS on
Gemini-S. This is an updated resubmission of proposals G/02A/11 and 
G/02B/07 which were both approved but not observed due to the delay 
of T-ReCS.
