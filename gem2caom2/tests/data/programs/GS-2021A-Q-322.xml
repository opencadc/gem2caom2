<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div style="max-width: 20cm">
As a continuation of our successful Gemini J-band monitoring campaign performed in 18B-19A, we propose to photometrically monitor 12 bright T8-T9 dwarfs visible in semester 21A to search for cloud-induced brightness variations. Brown dwarfs at the T/Y transition are predicted to have clouds of sulfide, salt, or water in their visible atmospheres. However, these cold faint objects have been under-represented in variability studies, which have focussed mainly on (brighter) L/T-transition objects, where the dominant clouds are made of silicates. Detecting the signatures of the more volatile clouds expected at the ~500 K T/Y transition will bring us closer to understanding the cloud dynamics in atmospheres with temperatures closer to Earth&#x27;s. While our time request is sizeable, our program is suitable for Band 3 queue-mode execution.
