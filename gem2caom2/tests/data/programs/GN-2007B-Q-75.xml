\Abstract{
Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs), a new class of molecular cloud
identified as deep mid-IR extinction features, are probably the
precursors to stellar clusters. Recent 1.2 mm continuum survey of
IRDCs reveals that they contain many compact cores with typical masses
of 100\,\Msun\, and sizes $\leq$ 0.5 pc.  \Spitzer\, 3--8\,\um\,
and 24\,\um\, images reveal $\sim$ 1/3 of these cores are sites of
active star formation.  The bright unresolved 24\,\um\, continuum
sources detected by \Spitzer\, directly indicate embedded
protostars. In addition, the active cores contain extended
3--8\,\um\ emission, with an enhancement at 4.5\,\um\ that might
arise from shocked H$_{2}$.  Molecular line emission towards the cores
show broad linewidths of HCN (4--3) and CS (3--2) and strong SiO
(2--1) emission, also indicative of star formation. The active cores'
large mm/submm/IR bolometric luminosities of $&gt;$10,000\,\Lsun\,
indicate that either a single high-mass protostar or a number of
lower-mass protostars are present within each core.  We
therefore request Gemini-N/Michelle time to determine the small-scale
structure of the bright 24\,\um\, sources in order to distinguish
between single and multiple protostars and Gemini-N/NIRI time to
investigate the enhanced 4.5\,\um\, emission of these cores.
